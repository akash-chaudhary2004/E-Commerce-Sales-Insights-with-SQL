# E-Commerce Store SQL Data Analyst Project

## Project Background ðŸŽ¯ðŸ“Š
Understanding sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends is essential for success in the e-commerce industry. This project aims to analyze an e-commerce store's sales data using SQL, uncovering key business insights that drive data-driven decisions. By examining various aspects of sales data such as revenue trends, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior we can identify opportunities for business growth and optimization.  

ðŸ“Œ **Our analysis follows a structured methodology that includes:**  

- **Database Initialization & Exploration**: Establishing a well-structured database and understanding its schema to ensure a solid foundation for analysis.  
- **Dimension & Date Range Exploration**: Investigating different factors affecting sales, including product categories, seasonal demand, and customer demographics.  
- **Sales Performance Evaluation**: Analyzing revenue, order volume, and key financial metrics to assess business health.  
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conducting magnitude analysis, ranking evaluations, and tracking revenue changes over time to derive meaningful insights.  

Through this analysis, we aim to support better decision-making regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation.
